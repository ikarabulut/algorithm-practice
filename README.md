<h1> Algorithm Practice </h1>

This repository is here to showcase my algorithm practice. You will find algorithms organized by type, and then by language completed. Within each
language folder you will see files for a specific algorithm and my solution.

<strong> My commits will show the algorithm submitted in what language and on what date, with the goal to go back as my skills improve and refactor </strong>
